Imputed GDP Data
================

Various GDP indicators have odd temporal domains. For example, World Bank is among the most current, but starts only in 1960. Penn World Table and Gleditsch's data have much nicer cross-sectional coverage. They even start earlier (typically: 1950). However, the right bound of the temporal domain is typically five years behind or so.

In this R script, I use a technique for GDP coverage introduced first by [Fearon and Laitin](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=142717&fileId=S0003055403000534) (2003, see [their appendix](http://web.stanford.edu/group/ethnic/workingpapers/addtabs.pdf)) and latter elaborated further in [Gibler and Miller](http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/51/5/634) (2014, also [see their appendix](http://dmgibler.people.ua.edu/uploads/1/3/8/5/13858910/anon2013etscappendix.pdf)). This technique involves gathering GDP or GNI data and regressing its natural logarithm on the natural logarithm of primary energy consumption data. Fearon and Laitin (2003) used country fixed effects to improve prediction. Gibler and Miller (2014) add year fixed effects as well.

This script cleans data in R, punts the data into Stata (which has an easier `predict` function), reloads the data.frame and creates new expected GDP variables with `ifelse` functions.

It requires the following data sources.

 - World Bank GDP per capita (constant $US 2005) and primary energy consumption data, which are gathered useing the `WDI` function in R.
 - Correlates of War National Military Cabilities data, currently in its fourth version.
 - Version 6 of Gleditsch's real GDP data.
 - A blank country-year data set generated by the EUGene program. This data frame includes all country years from 1946 to 2008.

While I set the the left-bound to 1946 (for my purposes), this approach is generalizable to analyses of pre-WWII GDP (should you need it with more current data). Instead of using World Bank or PWT, consider the Maddison Project data instead.
